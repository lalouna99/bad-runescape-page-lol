      <section class="main-section" id="Runescape_style_Python_mini_fishing_game">
        <header>Runescape style Python mini fishing game</header>
        <p>This is how to code a runescape themed mini fishing game in python!</p>
        <p>First, important "random", then create your fish list!</p>
        <code>import random

fish_list = ["Shrimp", "Anchovies", "Lobster", "Tuna", "Swordfish", "Shark"]
fishing_chance = [0.4, 0.3, 0.15, 0.08, 0.06, 0.01]</code>
<p>Next define the probabilities of catching each fish (corresponding to the fish_list)</p>
<code>fishing_chance = [0.4, 0.3, 0.15, 0.08, 0.06, 0.01]</code>
<p>Define the fish() function to simulate fishing</p>
<code>def fish():
    print("You cast your line into the water...")
    </code>
    <p>Generate a random number between 0 and 1 to simulate the fishing outcome</p>
    <code>catch = random.random()</code>
    <p>Loop through the fish_list and check if the catch falls within the probability range for each fish</p>
    <code>for i in range(len(fish_list)):
        if catch < fishing_chance[i]:</code>
        <p>If the catch falls within the probability range, print the caught fish and return from the function</p>
        <code>print(f"You caught a {fish_list[i]}!")
            return
        else:
            # If the catch does not fall within the probability range, subtract the probability of this fish from the catch
            catch -= fishing_chance[i]</code>
            <p>f the catch doesn't match any fish, it means nothing was caught, so print an appropriate message</p>
            <code> print("You didn't catch anything this time.")
</code>
<p>Define the main() function to run the fishing game</p>
<code>def main():
    print("Welcome to Old School RuneScape Fishing!")
    print("Try your luck and see what you can catch.")
        while True:
        print("\nOptions:")
        print("1. Fish")
        print("2. Quit")</code>

<p>Get the player's choice using the input() function</p>
<code>choice = input("Enter your choice (1 or 2): ")

        if choice == "1":
            # If the player chooses to fish, call the fish() function
            fish()
        elif choice == "2":</code>
            <p> If the player chooses to quit, print a goodbye message and break out of the loop to end the game</p>
           <code> print("Thanks for playing!")
            break
        else:</code>
            
          <p> If the player enters an invalid choice, print an error message and continue the loop to ask for a valid choice</p>
           <code> print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")</code>

<p>Check if the script is being run as the main program (not imported as a module)</p>
<code>if __name__ == "__main__":</code>

<p>If it is the main program, call the main() function to start the game
    </p>
<code>main()</code>
